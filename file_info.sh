#
# Usage:
# Place plug-in in /usr/lib/rackspace-monitoring-agent/plugins
#
# It accepts one argument, which should be the file you wish to check the mtime of.
#
# If the file is a symlink, it will dereference it.
#
# Returns 4 metrics:
#  - mtime: The time(unix epoch) the file was last modified
#  - age: The number of seconds that have elapsed since the file was modified
#  - size: The number of bytes of the file
#  - type: The type of file
#
# The following is an example 'criteria' for a Rackspace Monitoring Alarm:
#
# if (metric['age'] > 3600) {
#  return new AlarmStatus(CRITICAL, 'The file has not been modified in more than 1 hour. Last modified #{age} seconds ago');
# }
# return new AlarmStatus(OK, 'The file was last modified #{age} seconds ago.');
#
file=$1

if [ ! -e $file ]; then
  echo "status critical \"$file\" does not exist"
  exit 1
fi

if [ ! -r $file ]; then
  echo "status critical \"$file\" is not readable"
  exit 1
fi

mtime=$(stat --dereference -c%Y $file)
now=$(date '+%s')
age=$(( $now - $mtime ))
size=$(stat --dereference -c%s $file)
file_type=$(file -bL $file)

echo "status ok file statted"
echo "metric mtime uint64 $mtime"
echo "metric age uint64 $age seconds"
echo "metric size uint64 $size"
echo "metric type string $file_type"
exit 0
