# Depends on Dell's OMSA being installed along with Trond Hasle Amundsen's
# wonderful check_openmanage plugin for Nagios (avaiable via EPEL on RPM based
# distributions or directly from his web site:
# http://folk.uio.no/trondham/software/check_openmanage.html

# Usage:
# Place plug-in in /usr/lib/rackspace-monitoring-agent/plugins
#
# This plugin returns 1 metric:
#   - status : the exit status returned from the check_openmanage script
#
# The following is an example 'criteria' for a Rackspace Monitoring Alarm:
#
# :set consecutiveCount=3
#
# if (metric['status'] >= 3) {
#   return new AlarmStatus(CRITICAL, '#{report}');
# }
#
# if (metric['status'] == 2) {
#   return new AlarmStatus(CRITICAL, '#{report}');
# }
#
# if (metric['status'] == 1) {
#   return new AlarmStatus(WARNING, '#{report}');
# }
#
# return new AlarmStatus(OK, '#{report}');
#
# Things to keep in mind:
#   - this plugin will try to find check_openmanage in one of the "normal" distribution
#     managed paths where it might reside, or the actual shell path as a last resort.
#   - by default, we're ignoring uncertified drive warnings.  Feel free to change that
#     if it's important in your environment.
