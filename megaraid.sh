# Rackspace Cloud Monitoring Plug-In
# megaraid plugin to query SMART status of drives attached to LSI megaraid or
# DELL PERC {3,700} raid controllers.

#
# Usage:
# Place plug-in in /usr/lib/rackspace-monitoring-agent/plugins
#
# This plugin returns 5 metrics:
#   - failed    : the number of drives in failed state,
#   - prefail   : the number of drives in prefail state,
#   - unknown   : the number of drives for which the smart state could not
#                 be determined,
#   - ok        : the number of drives in OK state,
#   - report    : a string reporting the drive id, vendor, serial number
#                 as well as the smart state for non-ok drives.
#                 e.g. /dev/bus/0 -d megaraid,4 SEAGATE 6SL28GNF FAILED \
#                      ^controller & drive ids  ^vendor ^serial# ^state
#                 ( HARDWARE IMPENDING FAILURE GENERAL HARD DRIVE FAILURE [asc=5d, ascq=10] )
#                   ^SMART health status for this drive
#
# The following is an example 'criteria' for a Rackspace Monitoring Alarm:
#
# if (metric['failed'] != 0) {
#  return new AlarmStatus(CRITICAL, '#{failed} failed drive(s): #{report}');
# }

if (metric['prefail'] != 0) {
 return new AlarmStatus(WARNING, '#{prefail} prefail drive(s): #{report}');
}

# if (metric['unknown'] != 0) {
#  return new AlarmStatus(WARNING, '#{unknown} unknown drive(s): #{report}');
# }
#
# return new AlarmStatus(OK, '#{ok} drive(s) OK');
#
# Things to keep in mind:
#   - this plugin needs a fairly recent version of smartmontools (tested OK with 6.2)
#     (apt-get install smartmontools) but does NOT need megacli.
#   - on big and loaded arrays, the plugin can take more than 10s (default agent plugin
#     timeout) to complete. Some disks are slower than others, not surprisingly.
#   - as of now, this plugin only checks individual drives and not the status of the
#     array as seen by the controller. I'd add it, but it seems hard to extract without
#     megacli which I'm trying to stay away from. If you know of a way, please let me
#     know.
